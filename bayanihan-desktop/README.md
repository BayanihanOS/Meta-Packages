# bayanihan-desktop

Minimal gnome based desktop environment with customization

This meta-package depends on the standard distribution of the GNOME desktop environment, plus a complete range of plugins and other applications integrating with GNOME and Debian/BayanihanOS, providing the best possible environment to date.

Note: This source is built for amd64, to install on other architecture scripts need to be updated first.
